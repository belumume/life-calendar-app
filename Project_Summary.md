## Key Technical Decisions & Deviations

### 1. Database Technology Change
**Original Plan:** SQLite with SQLCipher
**Current Implementation:** IndexedDB with Web Crypto API
**Rationale:** Browser compatibility issues with SQLite on Windows/WSL
**Impact:** 
- Limits future sync capabilities
- Reduces query flexibility
- Complicates data export
- May require migration to SQLite later

### 2. Encryption Approach
**Original Plan:** SQLCipher for transparent database encryption
**Current Implementation:** Manual encryption with Web Crypto API
**Rationale:** SQLCipher not available in browser context
**Impact:**
- More complex encryption logic
- Per-field encryption instead of whole-database
- Salt management needs improvement

### 3. Architecture Pattern
**Implemented Well:**
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Clear separation of concerns
- Type-safe interfaces with TypeScript

## Conclusion

The MyLife Calendar has achieved its core MVP functionality with a working 88-day tracker and life visualization. However, significant architectural deviations (IndexedDB vs SQLite) will impact future development. The immediate focus should be on data export, enhanced journaling features, and planning for eventual migration to the originally intended architecture.

The app successfully demonstrates local-first, privacy-focused principles but needs additional work to fulfill the complete vision of a lifelong digital companion.
