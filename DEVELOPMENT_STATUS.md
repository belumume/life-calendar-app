# Development Status Report

## Summary of Code Review and Fixes

### Critical Security Issues Fixed âœ…
1. **Goals and Habits Encryption**: Fixed critical security vulnerability where goals and habits data were stored in plaintext. Now properly encrypted using the same E2E encryption as journal entries.

2. **Salt Encoding Security**: Fixed potential stack overflow vulnerability in salt encoding that used unsafe spread operator with large arrays. Now uses safe base64 encoding utilities.

3. **Authentication Rate Limiting**: Implemented comprehensive rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks (5 attempts in 15 minutes, 30-minute lockout).

### Major Issues Resolved âœ…
1. **PWA Icons**: Added placeholder icons to enable PWA installation
2. **IndexedDB Security**: Fixed missing 'iv' field in browserDB.getEntries() 
3. **Service Architecture**: Refactored monolithic 988-line AppService into 7 focused services
4. **Test Coverage**: Added 57 repository-layer tests

### Test Status
- **Unit Tests**: âœ… All 151 tests passing
- **Type Checking**: âœ… No TypeScript errors
- **Build**: âœ… Builds successfully
- **E2E Tests**: ðŸ”§ Created comprehensive test suite (requires browser dependencies)

### Technology Stack Deviations
- Using IndexedDB instead of planned SQLite/SQLCipher
- This is a significant deviation from the original plan but the implementation is solid

### Current Test Coverage
- Repository Layer: Well tested (57 tests)
- Service Layer: Good coverage
- Encryption: Comprehensive tests
- UI Components: Basic tests
- E2E: Tests written but need environment setup

## Next Steps
1. Document architecture decisions (ADRs)
2. Run full E2E test suite in proper environment
3. Consider migration path to SQLite if needed
4. Implement remaining features from project plan

## Commands Reference
```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server

# Testing
npm run test:unit        # Run unit tests
npm run test:e2e         # Run E2E tests (requires playwright browsers)
npm run test:e2e:ui      # E2E tests with UI
npm run typecheck        # TypeScript checking

# Build
npm run build            # Production build
```

## Security Improvements Implemented
1. All user data (journal, goals, habits) now E2E encrypted
2. Rate limiting on authentication
3. Safe base64 encoding utilities
4. Proper IV generation and storage
5. Zero-knowledge architecture maintained

The codebase is now significantly more secure and better organized than before the review.
